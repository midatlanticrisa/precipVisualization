## Questions and Responses

![](eval/Fig_EXP1.png)
\textcolor{blue}{Answer: Changes in the number of days per year with heavy rainfall events}

![](eval/Fig_EXP2.png)
\textcolor{blue}{Answer: To highlight patterns and trends in how heavy rainfall events change over time;
To compare how two future emissions scenarios of heavy rainfall events differ}

![](eval/Fig_EMP1.png)
\textcolor{blue}{Answer: 100% (minimum to maximum) of the range in model results}

![](eval/Fig_EMP2.png)
\textcolor{blue}{Answer: a range of values based on model results of a high emissions scenario}

![](eval/Fig_EMP3.png)
\textcolor{blue}{Answer: Model results over the historical period}

![](eval/Fig_ACC1.png)
\textcolor{blue}{Answer: Increase compared to the 1990-2019 observation average (greater than or equal to a 5% change)}

![](eval/Fig_ACC2.png)
\textcolor{blue}{Answer: Likely (66-100% probability)}

![](eval/Fig_ACC3.png)
\textcolor{blue}{Answer: One scenario average is less than a quarter of the size of the other;
There is little to no difference between the scenarios.} The difference is 0.2 days a year. 2.3 days for high emissions vs 2.1 days for low emissions.

![](eval/Fig_CHAL1.1.png)
\textcolor{blue}{Answer: No right or wrong answer.} Today heavy rainfall events happen 1.6 days per year and by 2050/2079 will increase to 2.1 or 2.3 days per year depending on the scenario

# Main Survey Questions/ Hypotheses

## Do participants who see graph type A understand and interpret the visual style better (regardless of speed) than participants who see graph type B and C?

### Hypotheses

#### Overall interpretation

Participants in Group 2 (Box and Whisker chart) will report the highest interpretation score. 

![](eval/Fig_Total.png)
TO DO: Add table with number of responders that scored higher than 50% and lower than 50%

#### Expressiveness

Participants in Group 2 (Box and Whisker chart) will respond to questions about the expressiveness of visual content more correctly than participants in Groups 1 & 3. 

![](eval/Fig_Expression.png)

TO DO: Add table with number of responders that scored higher than 50% and lower than 50%

#### Emphasis

(a) Participants in Group 3 (area chart) will respond to questions about the emphasis of visual elements more poorly than participants in Groups 1 & 2.

![](eval/Fig_Emphasis.png)

TO DO: Add table with number of responders that scored higher than 50% and lower than 50%

(b) Participants (regardless of group) will score poorly on questions about specialized terminology (jargon words) and other visual elements that are not highlighted in the legend or immediately intuitive.

![](eval/Fig_EmphasisJargon.png)

TO DO: Add table with number of responders that scored higher than 50% and lower than 50%

#### Accuracy

(a) Participants in Group 1 (bar chart) will more accurately interpret questions about average trends and compare scenario averages than participants in Groups 2 & 3. However, participants in Group 1 will score poorly on questions about ranges.

(b) Participants in Group 3 (area chart) will misinterpret average trends and comparisons between scenario averages more than participants in Groups 1&2. However, participants will score more accurately on questions about ranges than participants in Groups 1 & 2.

![](eval/Fig_AccTrend.png)
![](eval/Fig_AccRange.png)
TO DO: Add table with number of responders that scored higher than 50% and lower than 50%

(c) Participants in Group 2 (bow and whisker chart) will interpret the information in the visuals most completely. 

![](eval/Fig_Accuracy.png)

TO DO: Add table with number of responders that scored higher than 50% and lower than 50%

## Do participants who see graph type A understand and interpret the visual style FASTER (more efficiently) than participants who see graph type B and C?

![](eval/Fig_Time.png)

### Hypotheses

#### Efficiency

Participants in Group 1 (Bar charts) will respond to questions about the accuracy of visuals more quickly than participants in Groups 2 & 3.  

![](eval/Fig_AccTime.png)

## How does belief and knowledge of climate change influence our results?

### Hypotheses

#### Climate literacy

![](eval/Fig_ClimateLiteracy.png)

(a) Participants who select more risk-averse decisions in the decision scenarios will have higher climate literacy scores.

![](eval/Fig_RiskClim.png)

(b) Participants who score higher on interpreting the chart content will have higher climate literacy scores.

![](eval/Fig_ClimTot.png)

## Does the level of understanding and correct interpretation impact motivation to seek additional resources?

### Hypotheses

#### Motivation

![Motivation to seek out resources to learn more.](eval/Fig_MOT.png)

(a) Participants who score higher on questions about interpreting the chart content will be more likely to report that they will seek out climate information when making future decisions.

[](eval/Fig_MOTClim.png)

(b) Participants who score lower on questions about interpreting chart content will be more likely to report a desire to learn more about science and statistics.

[](eval/Fig_MOTSci.png)
[](eval/Fig_MOTStat.png)

(c) Participants who select more risk-averse decision options will be more likely to seek out resources on protecting their home and property from flooding, and less likely to move to an area with the rainfall projections displayed by the charts. 

[](eval/Fig_MOTFlood.png)

## Does visualization choice impact protective decision selection in Decision Scenarios?

### Hypotheses

#### Decision Scenarios

(a) Participants who score higher on questions about interpreting the chart content will select more protective decision options for the decision scenarios. 

[](eval/Fig_RiskTot.png)

(b) Participants in Group 1 will select the least protective decision options or choose to do nothing.

(c) Participants in Group 3 will select the most protective decision options.

[](eval/Fig_Risk.png)

## Do participants who see graph type A find the visual style more useful?

### Hypotheses

#### Usefulness

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a 10 item questionnaire with 5 response options.
from "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree". A raw SUS above 68 is above average and below 68 is below average. A SUS score of 68 is considered average. 

![](eval/Fig_SUS.png)
\newpage
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
usabilityID = c("USE2", "USE4", "USE6", "USE10", "USE12", "USE5", "USE7", "USE11", "USE13", "Q112")
useTable = data.frame(ID = usabilityID, Question = unlist(responses[1,usabilityID]))

kable(useTable, row.names = FALSE)
```

![](eval/Fig_SUS_IND.png)

Participants who score higher on questions about interpreting the chart content will believe the information is more useful than those with lower scores.

![](eval/Fig_SUSTot.png)

## Does an alternative presentation format (chart plus verbal interpretation) help interpretation?

### Hypotheses

#### Alternative presentation format

Participants will change their responses (if originally incorrect) and score higher on the questions about interpreting the information in the visuals.

![](eval/Fig_KM.png)

TO DO: Did people improve their score, if they changed their respose. How many did not change their respose?

## How do demographics influence our results?

### Hypotheses

#### Demographics

Participants who select more risk-averse decisions in the decision scenarios, have higher climate literacy scores and higher interpretation scores and are more likely to be female, young, wealthy, educated, and politically left.

TO DO: Make plots and stats
